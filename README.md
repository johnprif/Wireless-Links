# Signal Simulation
## This has been implemented for the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the University of Ioannina in the context of the course Wireless Links

**Convertion and optimization of matlab code  to octave for tool used in labs of wireless links.
We used octave in order to make that tool free and open source. This tool is used for simulation
and visualization to study the way of signal transmission and how it is affected by obstacles in 
place that looks like a city.**
